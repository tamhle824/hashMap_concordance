 This hash map uses a hash table of buckets, each containing a linked list of hash links. Each hash link stores the key-value pair (string and integer in this case) and a pointer to the next link in the list.

The program uses the hash map to Implement a word counter that counts the number of occurrences of all 
the words in a file. The word counter will return the top X words, as indicated by the user.
